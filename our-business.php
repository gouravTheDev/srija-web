<h2>Why develop a mobile app?</h2>
      <p>Use of mobile  devices is set to overtake desktop for accessing websites. Think about how  often you use your phone, or you see other people using theirs. It's common to  use your mobile to browse websites, search for information and make purchases.  A mobile app enhances the user experience further and achieves a greater  engagement with your users. Often a mobile app offers features that a mobile  web site (or web app) isn't capable of because it can have greater access to  the mobile device's hardware (such as GPS, camera and microphone).</p>
<h2>What's involved in building an app?</h2>
      <h5><strong>Planning</strong></h5>
      <p>Thorough  understanding of what you want and ensure we&rsquo;ve got all the information that we  need to design a solution to meet that.      </p>
      <h5><strong>Design and user experience</strong></h5>
      <p>We will look  at who your app needs to appeal to, and be appropriate for the intended  audience. It needs to be consistent with existing branding where applicable.      </p>
      <h5><strong>Development</strong></h5>
      <p>Creating the  working product based on those things using our experience with various  technologies to devise and develop a solution.      </p>
      <h5><strong>Testing</strong></h5>
      <p>We make sure  that what we&rsquo;ve produced is what we set out to produce, and ensure it all works  correctly on varied device types. We like automated and manual testing, making  sure that where possible we have automated tests to cover the design  functionality, backed up with the manual testing. You can&rsquo;t beat a human set of  eyes looking at it.      </p>
      <h5><strong>Support, analysis and  improvement</strong></h5>
We'll work to ensuring that product continues to perform in the way that  it&rsquo;s expected long after the product is launched. Long term support for mobile  apps is a key to its success as new devices and device updates often change the  underlying systems which could otherwise harm performance of the application.  And as user uptake of your application grows, we'll work with you to collect  and analyze information about usage and help to guide design changes and  enhancements. We like to maintain relationships with clients over the years,  supporting systems, offering advice and remaining a part of the project.
      <h2>Native, web and hybrid apps</h2>
      <p>There are  options for the type of mobile app you can build, depending on how you want it  to be used. A native app is specific to, for example, Android or iOS (Apple).  Generally, the result is slicker and perhaps better access to things such as  accelerator, camera, location, because it has built specifically for that  device. Mobile web apps are applications run via a website and can be seen in  the browser on your mobile phone. A hybrid app is a HTML5, CSS and Java script  web application (the same technology used for normal websites), that is then  adapted to be used on various devices. Hybrid apps are installed in the same  way (through App Store or Play Store), so depending on the features and/or  design, the user may never be aware of the difference. Hybrid apps do have some  limitations, but they have the benefit of being much quicker to develop and  deploy to different devices types.</p>
<h2>Web app development</h2>
      <p>Our team has  been developing interactive websites and web apps since 1997.</p>
<h2>What are web apps and how can they help me?</h2>
      <p>Webs apps are  pieces of online software that fulfill a purpose. A web app can be part of a  website or a separate software tool. It does not need to be installed, as users  access it through their web browser. For example, you may already have a  website but need an application to provide an online portal for subscribers. Or  you may need a complex, clever application that will take huge amounts of raw  data and extract certain information from it. An app - whatever it may be -  performs a function.</p>
<h2>Applications make life easier</h2>
      <p>Apps should  work hard so you don't have to. Or at least, allow you to spend your time doing  the things that a human does better than a machine. We're here to listen to  what you want, understand how it needs to work, and provide a solution. Even  the complex solutions will be as streamlined as much as possible when it comes  to using them. We like to put our heads together and come up with the best way  to utilize technology on behalf of our clients.</p>
<h2>Building, testing, supporting</h2>
      <p>We make sure  that what we&rsquo;ve produced is what we set out to produce, and ensure it all works  correctly on varied device types. We like automated and manual testing, making  sure that where possible we have automated tests to cover the design  functionality, backed up with the manual testing. You can&rsquo;t beat a human set of  eyes looking at it. </p>
<h2>Why choose web over desktop?</h2>
      <p>A web app is often  chosen due to ease of maintenance and support. Rather than having software  installed on your computer, it is hosted centrally in one place, and you login  to access. If there is a problem, an engineer does not usually need to look at  your computer. A device dependent desktop application will have limitations on  the type of computer it can be used on, for example developing something with  the Microsoft language has to run on Windows computers. A web app has greater  flexibility. Web apps do have limitations depending on the user having access  to a web browser, and an internet connection - although this is much less of a  limitation than in the past.</p>
<h2>E-Commerce  website development</h2>
<p>We can build  you a fully-featured online shop with a smooth, secure buying process and all  the design and management options you need. We've been making E-Commerce for  more than a decade and can take care of everything, so you can get selling.</p>
<h2>Easy and enjoyable shopping</h2>
      <p>Design and  functionality should make online shopping an intuitive, easy process that gives  you the best chance of conversion. The graphics and look should be suited to  your branding - whether that's a clean and crisp, quirky, super-slick or fun  and bright.</p>
<h2>Bespoke design</h2>
      <p>The details  of what is needed for an ecommerce system vary from business to business. We  can pretty much fulfill any request, giving you a bespoke online shop suited to  your requirements, guided by our experience. Complete CMS options, blog posts,  newsletters, offers, enhanced product pages, review features, product ratings,  data APIs, image carousels - there are lots of exciting, engaging additions  that can be integrated into a bespoke ecommerce website.</p>
<h2>Responsive - buy on your tablet or mobile</h2>
      <p>Lots of  people shop on their mobile - don't let a confusing shopping experience that  doesn't translate to the small mobile screen, lose you a sale. Creating a  mobile-friendly shopping cart or ecommerce website might mean adapting what you  have, starting from scratch, or implementing it as part of a new build.</p>
<h2>Secure payments and simple maintenance</h2>
      <p>A beautifully  designed and wonderfully intuitive website is just part of it. Customers want  and need to know their payments are safe and secure and we always include this  in our design. After the build, and during content or product listing, having a  simple administration or CMS system is also important. Our CMS systems are  always built with this in mind, to streamline the process and save you time.</p>
<h2>Customising a ready-made shop</h2>
      <p>At Srija, we  have been working hard to create an online shopping 'package' that will enable  smaller businesses or start-ups to get selling online quickly, safely, and with  no small amount of style. The idea is that instead of a bespoke design, you can  pay monthly for a customized version of an online shop that we have already  built.</p>
