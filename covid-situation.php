    <h3>How Web Presence Is Helping Businesses During The Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
    <p>When it comes to turning business challenges into opportunities, business owners have to be quick, agile, and creative. Workers are learning new skills and looking into different areas to find out solutions on how to continue serving its customers during the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the actions businesses are taking to keep up with the current situation and establishing new habits in favour of innovative solutions:</p>
      <h2>Moving online</h2>
      <p>Going online to offer learning tools and support to customers has become the immediate measure during this outbreak. Businesses with strategic insight and willingness to invest will be able to redefine the market by allowing employees to work from home and showing it is possible to keep moving forward. Mobility is perhaps the most critical step organizations can take when striving for lower costs, reduced churn, and increased productivity right now.</p>

      <h2>Grow your business</h2>
      <p>Whether or not you are an essential business, the economic impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has been substantial. Grocery stores and similar businesses are thriving, while gas stations and other auto services are essential and open for business, but have seen business plummet because people are not driving. Caterers used to feeding hundreds at a time are reinventing their business models completely to offer boxed meal and family-sized order services. Sit-down restaurants are making do with take-out and delivery, while missing out on the bigger-ticket dine-in business.</p>

<h2>Being More Flexible</h2>
      <p>We are experiencing a time when workers are placing more importance on company culture than vacation time and annual bonuses. For this reason, organizations must invest in a flexible workspace and allow employees to create a whole new routine to accommodate working hours and personal time. In order to continue in business, some companies have no other choice than to be more flexible by allowing employees to work on different hours and accommodate personal needs according to each individual’s lifestyle and role in the company.</p>
<h2>Providing The Tools</h2>
      While flexible workspaces are important for today’s workers, perhaps more important is the implementation of mobile-enabled workplace systems. Software solutions are enabling workers to stay connected and share real-time information. These tools enhance the user experience, making mobile working not just an extension of the traditional workplace, but an integral part of every single role in the company. Employees with the right tools and the freedom to perform by their own rules are left more creative, motivated, and engaged, which is the perfect recipe for a productive workforce
      <br>
      <p>This pandemic is forcing the business world to evolve at a rapid pace, leaving those who fear the unknown at the back of the pack. It’s time to move online. Moreover, we are experiencing a time when workers are placing more importance on company culture than vacation time and annual bonuses. Mobility and flexibility not only increase workforce performance but is also keeping businesses running during this crisis that has no end date.  <br>
